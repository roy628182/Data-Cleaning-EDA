# Data-Cleaning-EDA
A Python project demonstrating the process of converting raw data to clean data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
This repository showcases a step-by-step approach to cleaning and preprocessing raw data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 
The project includes:
    - Importing and loading raw data
    - Handling missing values and outliers
    - Data normalization and feature scaling
    - Data transformation and feature engineering
    - Visualizing data distributions and relationships

Data:
    - raw_data.csv: Sample raw data file
    - clean_data.csv: Cleaned and preprocessed data file
Libraries:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
